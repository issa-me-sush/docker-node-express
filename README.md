the docker image is split into multiple layers, and each line or command thats executed represents a layer and at  each of these they are cached. Optimization is carried out in this manner, by separating them , so that each time only the  changed or affected parts are executed again, and not everything.

The main purpose of the CMD command is to launch the software required in a container. For example, the user may need to run an executable .exe file or a Bash terminal as soon as the container starts – t​he CMD command can be used to handle such requests.
